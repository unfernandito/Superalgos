# Superalgos Beta 8 - Getting Started Guide

All procedures are the same for Windows, Linux, or Mac OS. Raspberry Pi terminal commands have been included for ease of use.

![superalgos-readme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13994516/106380124-844d8980-63b0-11eb-9bd9-4f977b6c183b.gif)

# Pre-Requisites

## Node JS

If you don't have it yet, download and install Node.js.

Node JS is an open-source server environment required to run Superalgos.

**a.** Go to the Node JS [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

**b.** Download your system’s installer. Select *LTS Recommended for Most Users* and click the big Windows or macOS Installer button. If you are on Linux, the installer is listed further down the page.

**c.** Run the installer with the default configuration — just click Next until Node.JS is fully installed.

**Raspberry Pi Users:** From the SSH Terminal, send the following commands to install Node. ::NOTE:: It is best to use the most current and updated version of the FULL PiOS image.
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
```
followed by 
```
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
It is recommended to install the Node Package Manager
```
sudo apt install npm
```
you may also type the following to verify the Node.js installation and version.
```
node -v
```

## Git

Download and install Git.

Git is an open-source distributed version control system required to download and stay up to date with Superalgos.

**a.** Go to the Git [download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

**b.** Download the version for your Operating System.

**c.** Run the installer with the default configuration — just click Next until Git is fully installed.

**IMPORTANT:** The latest version of Git is required to handle the authentication with GitHub.com.

**NOTE FOR MAC USERS:** Depending on your setup, installing Git may be optional. The native XCode Command Line Developer Tools seems to work well. If you do install Git, we have tested Tim Harper's binary installer successfully.

**Raspberry Pi Users:**
send the SSH Terminal command to install git. The most recent version of PiOS has Git already installed, so this may give you an error. The error will not affect your installation.
```
sudo apt-get install git
```

## Google Chrome or Safari

Use Chrome, or Safari on Mac. These are the only tested browsers.

**a.** Go to the Chrome [download page](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

**b.** Run the installer.

Before you begin, it is recommended that you set up Chrome/Safari as your default browser.

**IMPORTANT:** Use Chrome/Safari so that you have a similar environment as the dev team in case you need help. We are not testing on any other browsers, and it is a well-known fact that browsers behave differently.

# Superalgos Client Installation

**1.** Scroll the page all the way to the top. Find and click the **Fork** button to create your fork/copy of this repository. To fork Superalgos you need a GitHub account. If you don't have one, go ahead and create it. 

**NOTE:** A Fork is required for your contributions to the project. Superalgos will soon be moving into a new phase of development by incentivizing contributions. Incentives will be retroactive. The earlier in the life of the project you start contributing, the juicier your incentives will be, as the impact of contributions in a Community-driven project is clearly a function of time. This is an open invitation for you to become a vested member of the community!

**2.** Once the fork is created, you will land on the page of your fork. Copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

**3.** In your computer/laptop/server, open a command prompt or terminal as an administrator (to avoid issues with permissions) and type:

```
git clone 
```

**5.** Don't hit Enter yet! Complete the command by pasting the URL of your fork!

```
git clone + URL of your Superalgos fork.
```

For example, if your Github username is John, the command will look like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/John/Superalgos
```

Ok, you have installed Superalgos. To run the App, jump to the section Usage below.

## Installation Notes

**1.** You need to make a fork so that you may contribute work. Superalgos is a Community project and you are expected to contribute, like everyone else. You don't need to be a technical person to contribute. Fixing a typo in the docs or translating a paragraph into your native language are valuable contributions too. Superalgos has built-in features that make contributing easy. Help make Superalgos better and Superalgos will better serve you! [Free-riding is not cool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem), particularly on free, open-source, Community-driven projects.

**2.** The software includes an in-app self-update command / feature. It will help you stay up-to-date with the latest version of the software. Updates are on-demand, so don't worry about undesired updates. The project moves very fast and new features become available regularly, particularly if you choose to run the software in the ```develop``` branch (you may switch branches from within the app).

**3.** You are better off running the git clone command as an administrator to avoid permission issues while creating the Superalgos folder and downloading the repository. It may work without admin powers depending on your setup, particularly if you are running the command on a folder where you've got write permissions.

**4.** Before installing the client on a remote computer in an attempt to access the UI from a different machine, we highly recommend you do a standard installation on your PC / laptop first. Leave your Raspberry Pi or server for later, once you have done all available tutorials. This single tip will save you a lot of time: you don't need to add complexity before you learn how to handle the app.

# Usage

**1.** To run the Superalgos client, go to the Superalgos directory/folder and run this command: 

```
node run
```
If you are running a headless Raspberry Pi (one without a screen) it is recommended to use the following instead.
```
cd Superalgos
```
then
```
node run minMemo noBrowser
```

**2.** The command launches your default browser to load the UI. If Chrome/Safari is not your default browser, copy the URL, close the browser, open Chrome/Safari, and paste the URL. Be patient... it takes a few seconds to fully load the UI.

**3.** A Welcome Tutorial pops-up automatically. You must do this Tutorial to finish the setup and to learn the basics. It's the ultimate onboarding experience, superior to all other resources available, including videos and the docs.

## Usage Notes

**1.** We are testing the UI on Google Chrome and Safari on macOS only. It may work on other browsers as well &mdash; or not. If you are running on a different browser and ever need support, make sure you mention that fact upfront, or even better, try on Chrome/Safari first.

 **TIP:** If your computer has 8 GB of RAM or less, use ```node run minMemo``` to run the system with minimal RAM requirements.

# Uninstall

Superalgos writes nothing outside of the ```Superalgos``` folder. To completely uninstall the software, just delete the folder. 

# Welcome Tutorial

Once the app finishes loading, an interactive tutorial takes you by the hand and walks you all around the system while you learn the basic skills required to use the interface, mine data, backtest strategies, and even run a live trading session. It is highly recommended you follow the tutorial until the end, as it is carefully crafted to make your onboarding as easy as possible. Tutorials are the absolute best way to tackle the learning curve. You should do all tutorials before you start exploring other avenues on your own.

![welcome-tutorial-00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13994516/107038771-4a6bf100-67bd-11eb-92e0-353525a972a9.gif)

 **NOTE:** The tutorial uses Binance or Binance US as the exchange of choice. If you don’t have an account with Binance or Binance US, you will still be able to follow 100% of the tutorial. When you get to the live trading section, keep going even if you don't intend to run the session. You may learn how to work with other exchanges later on.

# Docker Deployments

We haven't tested containerized deployments, but many people in the community have. Worth noting is the fact that Superalgos doesn't touch anything outside the Superalgos folder. To uninstall, delete the folder.
